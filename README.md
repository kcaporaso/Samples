These are code samples of code I've written myself and represents my PHP OOP knowledge as well as some simple jQuery with live validation js.

Refer to the directories:

   MessageHandler\
   Services\

   This will show my recent implementation using Symfony's Messenger component that I've recently implemented
   where our application needs to create/update orders in HubSpot via their API.

   There is also a file in Services that shows how I create a CloudFlow session for our application via API. CloudFlow
   is a 3rd party approval service for all things print related.

   I can only provide partials due to proprietary reasons.
